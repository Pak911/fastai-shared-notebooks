Some useful functions for fastai tabular model analysing  
Hope the [notebook](https://github.com/Pak911/fastai-shared-notebooks/blob/master/interpret_tabular.ipynb) is self explanatory :)

Contains functions and examples of:
- How to make **prediction on a new dataset** with trained fastai model (learner)
- How to **use trained embeddings** in other process (to train **Random Forest** in this case)
- How to calculate **feature importance** in fastai
- How to calculate **partial dependence** for categorical features
- How to plot **dendrograms** for the data
- How to plot **embeddings**

Thanks to:
- [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) framework itself
- fastai Machine Learning course [lesson 3](https://youtu.be/YSFG_W8JxBo?t=4048) and [lesson 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo). Or if you prefer - the [notebook](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/ml1/lesson2-rf_interpretation.ipynb) of these tutorials  
My notebook is pretty much an implementation of these ones for fastai tabular model case (with some of my thoughts and experiments' results)
